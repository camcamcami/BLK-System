# BEB-K2-026 — R10 Failure-Reason Vocabulary Parity

**BEB ID:** BEB-K2-026
**Route revision:** R10 vocabulary parity remediation
**Target repository:** Kuronode-v2
**Target hash:** `cebe3d06b21b377f23adad0cf55f89d579dff804`
**Model:** `gpt-5.5`
**Direct requirement:** `REQ-KN-075`

## Objective

Remediate the post-R9 hostile-review blocker: R9 emitted `oversized-transaction-failure-reasons` but did not include that reason in the exported allowed failure vocabulary.

## Exact Artifacts

- Patch path: `BDOC-K2-026_R10_vocabulary_parity_exact_patch.diff`
- Patch SHA256: `sha256:7c434bf82237c1906a670815da9d735861a2f0e1aef0a0d9ff031bd06f9cb683`
- Patch bytes: `1318`
- Non-Git apply helper: `BDOC-K2-026_R10_apply_exact_patch_without_git.py`
- Helper SHA256: `sha256:289373520059ba5c6ec396161951e6650b40a8eddc38cb0475ab08e65602a0e0`
- Helper bytes: `976`

## Allowed Source Scope

Modified files only:

- `src/shared/governed-post-transaction-readiness-refresh.mjs`
- `tests/governed-post-transaction-readiness-refresh.test.mjs`

No new product files are authorized by R10.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Add a regression proving `oversized-transaction-failure-reasons` is present in `POST_TRANSACTION_READINESS_REFRESH_ALLOWED_VOCABULARY.failureReasons`.
- Add the missing exported vocabulary entry.
- Preserve all prior K2-026 behavior, including R8 K2-025 structural invariant checks, R9 sparse-array fail-closed handling, and all non-authorizing/no-leakage guarantees.

## Readiness profile probe card

These probes are required pre-dispatch checklist evidence only. They do not authorize source/Git mutation, parser execution, provider/runtime dispatch, BEO publication, RTM generation, or reusable BLK-pipe/Codex authority beyond the exact approved drop.

### kuronode-governed-write-transaction-v1

- [ ] KGWT-001 real K2-024 admission record produced by createAgentAWriteAdmissionRecord commits through the controlled fixture path
- [ ] KGWT-002 minimal or forged admission-shaped records fail closed before transaction commit
- [ ] KGWT-003 admission, promotion request, package, and transaction request identity/hash fields must match exactly
- [ ] KGWT-004 authority, approval, provider, publication, RTM, blk-link, save/export/session, and raw-marker aliases fail closed across admission/package/request metadata
- [ ] KGWT-005 target path, targetPaths, packagePaths, targetPackagePaths, files, absolute path, traversal, and multi-file aliases fail closed
- [ ] KGWT-006 stale before-version hash, candidate replacement hash mismatch, unsupported package kind, and missing operator review evidence return commit-failed no-op recovery
- [ ] KGWT-007 hostile JavaScript objects, proxies, getters, accessors, symbols, functions, revoked proxies, and cyclic evidence fail closed without invoking caller code
- [ ] KGWT-008 transaction IDs, recovery records, denied-authority flags, and evidence hashes are deterministic, deep-frozen, and leak no raw prompt/source/provider/path/body material
- [ ] KGWT-009 readiness-refresh-required evidence is recorded without running RTM, blk-link, provider, filesystem write, publication, signing, storage, or ledger side effects
- [ ] KGWT-010 closeout includes a named hostile matrix for admission spoofing, package/request aliases, raw-marker non-leakage, and commit-or-fail/no-op recovery
